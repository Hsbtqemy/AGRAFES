# Decisions — multicorpus_engine

Mini ADRs (Context -> Decision -> Consequences).
This file is the consolidated source of truth after the 2026-02-28 stabilisation pass.

## ADR-001 — `external_id` extraction from DOCX numbered lines

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
HIMYC-style DOCX sources encode alignable lines as `[n] content` paragraphs.

**Decision**
- Parse numbered lines with regex: `^\[\s*(\d+)\s*\]\s*(.+)$`.
- Matching paragraph -> `unit_type="line"`, `external_id=int(n)`, indexed in FTS.
- Non-matching paragraph -> `unit_type="structure"`, `external_id=NULL`, preserved but not indexed.
- Import diagnostics must report duplicates, holes, non-monotonic ids.

**Consequences**
- Anchor-based alignment is possible (`external_id` shared across docs).
- Structure paragraphs remain available for context without polluting search results.

---

## ADR-002 — `¤` separator policy (Option 2)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Some sources use `¤` as an inline segment separator.

**Decision**
- `text_raw`: keep `¤` unchanged.
- `text_norm`: replace each `¤` with one ASCII space.
- Display helper: `text_display(text_raw)` replaces `¤` by `" | "`.
- `sep_count` may be stored in `meta_json` for analytics.

**Consequences**
- Search over `text_norm` is separator-agnostic.
- UI can still render visual segment boundaries from raw text.

---

## ADR-003 — Unicode normalization policy for `text_norm`

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Corpus sources contain mixed encodings, spacing conventions, and invisible characters.

**Decision**
Apply the following normalization pipeline before indexing:
- Unicode NFC.
- Normalize line endings (`CRLF`/`CR` -> `LF`).
- Remove invisibles (`ZWSP`, `ZWNJ`, `ZWJ`, `WORD JOINER`, `BOM`, soft hyphen).
- Normalize `NBSP` (`U+00A0`) and `NNBSP` (`U+202F`) to ASCII space.
- Replace `¤` with ASCII space (per ADR-002).
- Strip ASCII controls `U+0000..U+001F` except `TAB`, `LF`, `CR`.

**Consequences**
- `text_norm` is deterministic and search-safe.
- `text_raw` remains the faithful source text.

---

## ADR-004 — Run logging and reproducibility

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Operations must be auditable and replayable from machine-readable metadata.

**Decision**
- Every CLI operation creates a `runs` row (`run_id`, `kind`, `params_json`, `stats_json`, `created_at`).
- Detailed logs are written to `<db_dir>/runs/<run_id>/run.log`.
- Stdout remains reserved for one JSON summary object.

**Consequences**
- Tauri can parse stdout deterministically.
- Operational diagnosis relies on run logs and persisted run stats.

---

## ADR-005 — FTS5 indexing strategy

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Search index must remain simple, deterministic, and tied to corpus units.

**Decision**
- `fts_units` is a regular FTS5 table (`text_norm`), not an external-content table.
- Insert rows with `rowid = units.unit_id`.
- Index only `units.unit_type='line'`.
- Current indexing mode is full rebuild (`DELETE FROM fts_units` + reinsert eligible units).
- Incremental indexing is deferred and must be introduced behind an explicit design/test gate.

**Consequences**
- Join semantics are stable (`fts_units.rowid -> units.unit_id`).
- Structure units are intentionally excluded from search.
- Rebuild is robust and easy to reason about, with predictable cost.

---

## ADR-006 — Query output modes

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Concordance workflows require two complementary views of a match.

**Decision**
- `segment` mode returns the full normalized unit with highlighted match.
- `kwic` mode returns `left/match/right` windows.
- `--all-occurrences` in KWIC returns one hit per match occurrence.

**Consequences**
- API stays compact while serving both browsing and concordance use cases.

---

## ADR-007 — Alignment duplicate handling

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Duplicate `external_id` values can appear in source documents.

**Decision**
- Use first occurrence (lowest `n`) for ambiguous duplicates.
- Report duplicates and missing anchors in alignment reports.

**Consequences**
- Alignment remains deterministic even on imperfect sources.
- Users are informed of data quality issues instead of silent mismatch.

---

## ADR-008 — Structure units are preserved but non-indexed

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Headings and document scaffolding are useful context but hurt lexical search quality.

**Decision**
- Keep structure paragraphs in `units` as `unit_type='structure'`.
- Exclude them from FTS indexing and default query hits.

**Consequences**
- Search precision is improved.
- Context remains available for export/rendering/audit paths.

---

## ADR-009 — TEI export strategy

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
TEI export must be valid XML 1.0 and safe for downstream processing.

**Decision**
- Use stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` for generation.
- Escape XML-sensitive content and strip XML 1.0 invalid code points.
- UTF-8 output with XML declaration.
- Export line units by default; structure units remain optional.

**Consequences**
- Export stays dependency-light and robust across platforms.

---

## ADR-010 — Metadata validation model

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Metadata quality must be observable without blocking ingest workflows.

**Decision**
- `validate_document` / `validate_all_documents` return structured warnings.
- Missing required fields (`title`, `language`) set `is_valid=false`.
- CLI `validate-meta` reports `status=ok|warnings`, not hard failures by default.

**Consequences**
- Data quality can be monitored continuously with non-destructive checks.

---

## ADR-011 — TXT encoding detection

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
TXT files arrive in mixed encodings.

**Decision**
- Detection order: BOM -> `charset-normalizer` (if installed) -> `cp1252` -> `latin-1`.
- Persist encoding metadata in `documents.meta_json`.
- Keep importer operational without optional dependency installed.

**Consequences**
- Good default interoperability with deterministic fallback behavior.
- Encoding fallback (cp1252/latin-1) is not written to stderr: it is logged only to the run log (CLI) when `run_logger` is provided, and added to import run `stats_json.warnings` as `{"type": "encoding_fallback", "path": "...", "chosen": "cp1252"}` so that CLI/sidecar stderr stays empty (contract hardening).

---

## ADR-012 — DOCX paragraphs importer

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Some corpora do not provide `[n]` anchors.

**Decision**
- Import non-empty paragraphs as `unit_type='line'`.
- Assign monotone `external_id = n`.

**Consequences**
- Documents become alignable by position even without explicit anchors.

---

## ADR-013 — Position-based alignment fallback

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Anchor-based alignment is not always available.

**Decision**
- Provide alignment by shared sequential position `n`.
- Report missing positions on each side.

**Consequences**
- Predictable fallback with clear limitations on structural divergence.

---

## ADR-014 — TEI basic importer

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
TEI corpora must be ingestible with minimal dependencies.

**Decision**
- Import `<p>` or `<s>` units using stdlib XML parser.
- Resolve language/title from TEI metadata with CLI override support.
- Derive `external_id` from numeric suffix of `xml:id` when available.

**Consequences**
- Broad TEI compatibility while keeping importer simple and deterministic.

---

## ADR-015 — Curation engine on `text_norm`

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Post-import text normalization sometimes requires corpus-specific regex corrections.

**Decision**
- Apply ordered regex rules to `text_norm` (`curate` command).
- Keep `text_raw` unchanged.
- Mark FTS as stale after any modification.

**Consequences**
- Curation is reproducible and auditable, with explicit reindex requirement.

---

## ADR-016 — Sidecar API contract and optional runtime role

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Tauri integration needs a localhost API without making sidecar mandatory for CLI users.

**Decision**
- Sidecar contract is versioned (`api_version`), exposed by `GET /openapi.json`.
- Standard error codes: `BAD_REQUEST`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- Async jobs are supported via `/jobs` and `/jobs/{job_id}` for `index`, `curate`, `validate-meta`, `segment`.
- Sidecar is optional; CLI remains the primary integration baseline.

**Consequences**
- Contract-first integration is possible for Tauri.
- Projects can operate in CLI-only mode with no sidecar dependency.

---

## ADR-017 — Segmentation strategy (line -> sentence)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Some workflows require sentence-level units while source imports are line-based.

**Decision**
- Provide regex-based resegmentation (`segment` command) from line units.
- Delete stale alignment links touching the segmented document.
- Do not auto-rebuild FTS; return `fts_stale=true` and require explicit `index`.

**Consequences**
- Segmentation remains controlled and reversible at workflow level.
- Post-segmentation consistency is explicit (alignment/FTS refresh required).

---

## ADR-018 — Similarity alignment fallback

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
When anchors and positions both fail, a fuzzy fallback is still useful.

**Decision**
- Provide `align --strategy similarity` using normalized edit-distance similarity.
- Greedy one-to-one target matching with configurable threshold.

**Consequences**
- More recall on noisy corpora, at the cost of score-dependent ambiguity.
- Threshold tuning remains a user responsibility.

---

## ADR-019 — CLI JSON envelope contract

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Frontend integration fails when commands emit mixed logs/text and inconsistent JSON shapes.

**Decision**
- CLI emits exactly one JSON object on stdout per invocation.
- Success payloads include `status` (`ok`, `warnings`, or command-specific non-error status such as `listening`).
- Error payloads include `status="error"`, `error`, and `created_at`, with exit code `1`.
- Parser/validation failures from `argparse` (missing args, invalid choices, unknown subcommand) must use the same JSON error envelope and must not emit usage text to stderr.
- Human-readable diagnostics stay in run log files.

**Consequences**
- Tauri can treat stdout as strict machine I/O.
- Contract regressions become testable via subprocess smoke tests (success path + parse-failure path).

---

## ADR-020 — Sidecar binary packaging via PyInstaller (onefile)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Tauri desktop packaging requires platform-specific sidecar binaries, while the
core engine must remain UI-independent and CLI-contract stable.

**Decision**
- Use PyInstaller in `onefile` mode to package the CLI as a sidecar binary.
- Add a stable packaging entrypoint `scripts/sidecar_entry.py` that only calls
  `multicorpus_engine.cli.main`.
- Build with `scripts/build_sidecar.py`, output to
  canonical app path `tauri/src-tauri/binaries/` and optional fixture path
  `tauri-fixture/src-tauri/binaries/` via presets.
- Bundle SQL migrations inside the PyInstaller artifact and resolve migration
  directory from `sys._MEIPASS` when running in bundled mode.
- Binary naming convention:
  - macOS/Linux: `multicorpus-<target_triple>`
  - Windows: `multicorpus-<target_triple>.exe`
- Target triple resolution:
  1. `rustc --print host-tuple` when available.
  2. deterministic fallback mapping by OS/arch.
- Write `sidecar-manifest.json` with:
  `name`, `target_triple`, `version`, `sha256`, `build_time`.
- Keep packaging dependency isolated in optional extra
  `[project.optional-dependencies].packaging` (`pyinstaller` only).

**Consequences**
- Local macOS packaging and CI matrix packaging become reproducible.
- Runtime/core dependencies stay minimal for non-packaging users.
- Signing/notarization and advanced binary hardening remain explicit backlog items.

---

## ADR-021 — Tauri E2E fixture strategy + onefile baseline

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
We need cross-platform end-to-end confidence that Tauri sidecar execution
respects the CLI JSON contract, without requiring a full UI test harness.
We also need an explicit baseline for onefile packaging tradeoffs.

**Decision**
- Add a minimal headless fixture under `tauri-fixture/` (no product UI).
- Validate E2E by running the sidecar CLI directly from fixture smoke script:
  - `init-project` success JSON + `rc=0`
  - `query` success JSON + `rc=0`
  - invalid-arg error JSON + `rc=1`
  - stderr must remain empty in fixture checks
- Add workflow `.github/workflows/tauri-e2e-fixture.yml`:
  - build sidecar artifacts in matrix (`macos`, `ubuntu`, `windows`)
  - run fixture smoke in matrix using downloaded artifacts
- Keep PyInstaller `onefile` as current baseline.
- Add startup/size benchmark script `scripts/bench_sidecar_startup.py` to gather
  data for future onefile vs onedir evaluation.

**Consequences**
- We get reproducible, UI-independent integration checks on all target OSes.
- GUI runner constraints do not block contract validation in CI.
- Onefile remains default until measured evidence justifies switching to onedir.

---

## ADR-022 — Persistent sidecar HTTP for UX (serve once, query many)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
PyInstaller onefile cold-start cost is noticeable for one-shot CLI invocations
in interactive desktop UX. Tauri integration needs a low-latency multi-request path.

**Decision**
- Standardize a persistent sidecar process started with:
  - `multicorpus serve --db ... --host 127.0.0.1 --port 0|NNNN`
- Provide minimum HTTP endpoints for persistent workflows:
  - `GET /health`
  - `POST /import`
  - `POST /index`
  - `POST /query`
  - `POST /shutdown`
- Keep strict JSON envelope with `ok` + `status` and structured errors.
- Write sidecar discovery file next to DB:
  - `.agrafes_sidecar.json` containing `host/port/pid/started_at/db_path`.
- Implement graceful shutdown path:
  - `/shutdown` stops server, closes DB, removes portfile.
- Keep CLI one-shot path as fallback compatibility mode.

**Consequences**
- Tauri can start sidecar once and reuse HTTP calls for responsive UX.
- Persistent lifecycle (restart/crash/stale portfile/security policy) becomes a
  first-class operational concern and remains tracked in backlog.

---

## ADR-023 — Restart policy + optional localhost token

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Persistent sidecar mode needs deterministic startup behavior in the presence of
stale portfiles, and a lightweight localhost guard without introducing heavy
web dependencies.

**Decision**
- Startup policy for `multicorpus serve`:
  - inspect existing `.agrafes_sidecar.json` using PID + `/health` probe
  - if PID alive and `/health` is OK, return `status="already_running"` and do
    not launch a second process
  - otherwise treat portfile as stale, remove it, and start a fresh sidecar
- Add `multicorpus status --db ...` for state discovery:
  - `running`, `stale`, or `missing`
- Add optional token mode for localhost write endpoints:
  - `serve --token auto|off|<value>` (`auto` default)
  - token is persisted in portfile when active
  - require `X-Agrafes-Token` for `/import`, `/index`, `/shutdown`
  - return `401` with `UNAUTHORIZED` on missing/invalid token

**Consequences**
- Sidecar lifecycle is deterministic and easier to integrate from Tauri.
- Default persistent mode is safer on localhost without breaking compatibility:
  `--token off` preserves previous open behavior.
- Advanced auth (scoped tokens, rotation, ACL) remains explicit backlog.

---

## ADR-024 — Distribution pipeline with conditional signing/notarization

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Desktop distribution needs OS-specific signing/notarization, but CI must remain
usable without privileged credentials in forks and early setup stages.

**Decision**
- Add dedicated distribution scripts:
  - macOS sidecar sign/notarize
  - macOS representative Tauri app sign/notarize
  - Windows sidecar signing
  - Linux manylinux sidecar build
- Add CI workflows for macOS, Windows, Linux distribution lanes.
- Gate signing/notarization by presence of GitHub Secrets.
- If secrets are missing:
  - keep build green
  - publish unsigned artifacts
  - emit explicit warnings
- Keep release workflow on `v*` tags with artifact aggregation and publication.

**Consequences**
- Distribution can start immediately, with incremental hardening as secrets are
  provisioned.
- Security-sensitive operations stay out of repository content.
- CI behavior is deterministic across signed/unsigned modes.

---

## ADR-025 — Sidecar packaging format default (onefile vs onedir)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Decided

**Context**
`onefile` improves distribution simplicity but can increase cold-start. `onedir`
can reduce launch overhead at the cost of larger artifact sets and packaging
complexity.

**Decision**
- Extend build tooling to support both `--format onefile|onedir`.
- Extend benchmark tooling to capture startup latency and size metrics for both.
- Add CI matrix benchmark workflow (`.github/workflows/bench-sidecar.yml`) and
  aggregation script (`scripts/aggregate_bench_results.py`) to produce
  `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- Bench CI policy for persistent runs:
  - fixture input file is written explicitly as UTF-8 with LF newlines
  - stderr remains strict by default, but known benign benchmark warning lines
    can be allowlisted (unknown stderr lines still fail the benchmark)
- Final decision scope: `per_os`.
- Default mapping when `--format` is omitted:
  - `darwin` -> `onefile`
  - `linux` -> `onedir`
  - `windows` -> `onedir`
- CI workflows use explicit per-OS `--format` flags to avoid ambiguity.

Benchmark basis (from `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`):

| OS | Choice | Startup gain of onedir vs onefile | Size growth (onedir / onefile) | Rationale |
|----|--------|-----------------------------------:|---------------------------------:|-----------|
| macOS | onefile | +64.2% | 3.79x | Startup gain is strong, but size exceeds accepted 2.5x threshold. |
| Linux | onedir | +70.9% | 2.28x | Startup gain exceeds threshold and size growth stays within limit. |
| Windows | onedir | +73.0% | 2.07x | Startup gain exceeds threshold and size growth stays within limit. |

**Consequences**
- Sidecar build defaults now depend on OS when `--format` is not provided.
- Linux/Windows release lanes publish `onedir` sidecars by default.
- macOS release and fixture lanes keep `onefile` by default.
- Tauri integration must support both artifact layouts:
  - `onefile`: single executable
  - `onedir`: directory bundle with renamed executable inside
- Current benchmark summary remains tracked in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.

---

## ADR-026 — Segmentation quality packs (V0 scaffold)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
`tauri-prep` needed a first V1 step to select language-aware segmentation behavior
without introducing heavy NLP dependencies or breaking existing workflows.

**Decision**
- Add an optional segmentation `pack` parameter across CLI/sidecar/job paths.
- Supported values:
  - `auto` (default): resolves from `lang` (`fr* -> fr_strict`, `en* -> en_strict`, else `default`)
  - `default`, `fr_strict`, `en_strict`
- Expose the selected pack in segmentation responses as `segment_pack`.
- Add a pack selector in `tauri-prep` Actions screen and forward it to `/jobs/enqueue` segment requests.

**Consequences**
- Backward compatibility is preserved (no `pack` still works via default `auto`).
- Segmentation quality can now be tuned per workflow before adding richer fixtures/metrics.
- Further pack refinement remains in backlog (evaluation fixtures + measurable quality targets).

---

## ADR-027 — Hybrid alignment strategy (`external_id_then_position`)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Some corpora are partially anchored: many lines share `external_id`, but some
rows are missing or drifted. Pure `external_id` leaves avoidable gaps; pure
`position` can over-link when anchors exist.

**Decision**
- Add strategy `external_id_then_position`:
  1. align by `external_id` first (anchor-first behavior preserved)
  2. align remaining unmatched rows by shared position `n`
- Expose strategy in CLI, sidecar `/align`, and async jobs (`/jobs/enqueue`).
- Keep response shape backward-compatible and include `links_skipped` in reports.

**Consequences**
- Better default recall on partially anchored corpora without abandoning anchors.
- UI (`tauri-prep`) can offer a practical fallback strategy with a single toggle.
- Rich explainability UI/scoring visualization remains backlog (debug payload hook exists via ADR-028).

---

## ADR-028 — Optional align explainability payload (`debug_align`)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Advanced alignment strategies are harder to trust without visibility on which
phase produced links (anchor, position fallback, similarity).

**Decision**
- Add optional flag `debug_align` (default `false`) to:
  - CLI `align`
  - sidecar `POST /align`
  - sidecar align jobs (`POST /jobs/enqueue`, kind `align`)
- When enabled, each report may include `debug` payload with:
  - strategy id
  - per-phase link source counts
  - optional sample links
  - similarity stats where relevant (min/max/mean)
- Keep default responses unchanged when `debug_align=false`.

**Consequences**
- Backward compatibility is preserved.
- Tauri prep can surface diagnostics on-demand without additional queries.
- Explainability UI is now available in `tauri-prep` Actions (dedicated panel + JSON copy);
  export/report integration remains backlog.

---

## ADR-029 — Segmentation quality benchmark protocol (FR/EN fixtures)

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
`pack` support (`auto/default/fr_strict/en_strict`) was available, but quality
evaluation stayed manual and non-repeatable. We needed a lightweight, deterministic
way to compare packs and detect regressions.

**Decision**
- Add a small FR/EN fixture dataset:
  - `bench/fixtures/segmentation_quality_cases.json`
- Add a benchmark script:
  - `scripts/bench_segmentation_quality.py`
  - computes:
    - sentence exact-match rate
    - boundary precision / recall / F1
  - writes:
    - JSON artifact in `bench/results/`
    - Markdown summary in `docs/SEGMENTATION_BENCHMARKS.md`
- Define abbreviation matching as case-insensitive in segmentation packs,
  so sentence-initial abbreviations (e.g. `Approx.` / `Etc.`) are treated
  consistently.

**Consequences**
- Segmentation quality can be tracked with reproducible metrics in CI/local runs.
- `auto` pack behavior becomes measurable against strict and default baselines.
- Future pack changes should update fixture coverage and benchmark summary.

---

## ADR-030 — Align explainability must be linked to persisted runs

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Explainability payloads (`debug_align`) were available in align responses, but
tracking/exporting them was fragile because sidecar align operations were not
consistently persisted in the `runs` table.

**Decision**
- `POST /align` now always returns `run_id` and persists an `align` run:
  - `params_json` includes strategy/pivot/targets/debug flag
  - `stats_json` includes `total_links_created` and full `pairs` reports
- Async align jobs (`POST /jobs/enqueue`, kind `align`) now return `run_id` and
  persist the same run stats.
- `tauri-prep` Actions explainability payload now carries the `run_id`.
- `tauri-prep` Exports run-report workflow supports optional `run_id` filter.

**Consequences**
- Explainability traces are exportable and reproducible via run history.
- Existing clients remain compatible (new fields are additive).
- Auditing/debug workflows can reference one stable identifier (`run_id`) end-to-end.

---

## ADR-031 — Document workflow status for Prep finalization

**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The Prep UX now distinguishes clearly between:
- document-local completion (`Valider ce document`)
- optional batch actions.

Without a persisted document workflow state, this decision remains purely visual
and cannot drive navigation, filtering, or downstream automation reliably.

**Decision**
- Add persistent workflow fields on `documents`:
  - `workflow_status` (`draft` | `review` | `validated`, default `draft`)
  - `validated_at` (nullable timestamp)
  - `validated_run_id` (nullable run reference string)
- Expose these fields in `GET /documents`.
- Extend `POST /documents/update` and `POST /documents/bulk_update` to support
  `workflow_status`.
- Validation metadata behavior:
  - setting `workflow_status="validated"` auto-fills `validated_at` if missing
  - switching to `draft` or `review` clears `validated_at` and `validated_run_id`

**Consequences**
- Prep can implement deterministic post-validation routing (e.g. return to
  `Documents`) with a stable persisted state.
- Existing clients stay compatible (additive fields and optional inputs).
- Batch and per-document workflows become auditable and queryable.

---

## ADR-032 — Deep-link contract between `tauri-prep` and AGRAFES apps

**Date:** 2026-03-03  
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The Prep -> Concordancier handoff depended on manual copy/paste of DB paths, which
added friction and frequent user errors. After introducing `tauri-shell` as the
primary app, the handoff target needed to be shell-first.

**Decision**
- Define a stable handoff URI contract:
  - shell-first URI: `agrafes-shell://open-db?mode=explorer&path=<absolute_db_path>`
  - accepted aliases on consumer side: `path` (preferred), `db` / `open_db` (compat)
- In `tauri-prep`, add topbar action `↗ Shell`:
  - build URI from current DB path
  - attempt immediate open
  - keep copy/manual fallback behavior
- In `tauri-shell`, integrate `tauri-plugin-deep-link`:
  - process startup payload via `getCurrent()`
  - process runtime payloads via `onOpenUrl(...)`
  - switch DB only for valid SQLite path candidates (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`)
  - ignore invalid/unexpected payloads safely
- Keep standalone `tauri-app` deep-link intake (`agrafes://open-db`) for compatibility.

**Consequences**
- Prep can hand off directly into the primary unified app (`tauri-shell`) without
  forcing users through manual DB selection.
- User workflow friction is reduced while preserving manual fallback and standalone
  compatibility.
- Contract remains additive and does not affect CLI/sidecar JSON behavior.

## ADR-033 — DB backup safety checkpoint in Prep Documents tab

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
Metadata edits in `tauri-prep` (single/bulk + workflow status) need a visible
safety checkpoint before large write operations.

**Decision**
- Add sidecar endpoint `POST /db/backup` (token required).
- Endpoint creates a timestamped backup file in `.db.bak` format:
  - default target directory = current DB directory;
  - optional `out_dir` override accepted.
- In `tauri-prep` Documents tab, expose `Sauvegarder la DB` and show:
  - latest backup status text,
  - full backup path in the log panel.

**Consequences**
- Backup generation is centralized in backend (consistent behavior across
  Tauri wrappers).
- Users get an explicit recovery checkpoint before metadata batch work.
- Change is additive and does not alter CLI/sidecar JSON envelope contract.

---

## ADR-034 — Readable text exports in async job pipeline (TXT/DOCX)

**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**
The unified Export V2 flow in `tauri-prep` exposed “Texte lisible” as pending,
which blocked a common user expectation: exporting reviewed/segmented content in
editable formats.

**Decision**
- Add async job kind `export_readable_text` to sidecar `/jobs/enqueue`.
- Support output formats:
  - `txt` (UTF-8)
  - `docx` (via `python-docx`, already a project dependency)
- Export scope:
  - `doc_ids` optional (`None` => all documents)
  - default source field: `text_norm` (stable post-curation/segmentation view)
  - optional flags: `include_structure`, `include_external_id`, `source_field`
- Apply strict enqueue-time validation for this job:
  - `format` must be `txt|docx`
  - `doc_ids` must be an array of positive integers when provided
  - `source_field` must be `text_norm|text_raw`
  - optional flags must be booleans when provided
- Wire `tauri-prep` Export V2 card to this job for segmentation/curation flows
  (remove pending placeholder state for TXT/DOCX).

**Consequences**
- “Texte lisible” is now operational in runtime (not just a roadmap placeholder).
- Contract remains backward-compatible (additive job kind + optional params).
- No change to core JSON envelope policy (`ok/error`) for sidecar responses.
